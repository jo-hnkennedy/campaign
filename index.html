	Born on February 27, 1979, John learned the value of hard work at an early age working on his family's pecan farm. At the age of 16 he started his first small business: <i>ayuda</i>, leveraging his fluent Spanish to manage and connect migrant agricultural workers with opportunity. After his third year as a business major at Georgia Tech, John worked as a missionary and teacher in the slums of Zambia in the summer of 1999. That September, he returned to Lusaka to launch <i>sukulu</i>, the first charter school in Zambia. <i>sukulu</i> has since grown to 15 schools in the Zambian capitol, preparing over 30,000 Zambian children for a world of opportunity. John ran for Governor of Georgia in 2010, and has served six years, focusing on education spending and increasing the potential of Southern small business. He has a wife, Patricia, and adopted Zambian sons John V and Austin.</p>

		John's flagship legislative effort as Governor was the 2012 PEACH Bill. By reforming the outdated legal code and slashing prison budgets, John was able to double the education budget and fund specialty programs like computer science and hardware design. As a result, the number of Georgian computer science graduates and software startups are both projected to double. John will take this same approach as President. Education transforms households, increases income across the board while reducing poverty. But instead of forcing outdated standards across the states, John will replicate his Georgia success by opening up billions for specialized funding as well as vast subsidies in community college, even full scholarships for families under $80,000 total income.</p>
