	Born on February 27, 1979, John learned the value of hard work at an early age working on his family's pecan farm. At the age of 16 he started his first small business: <i>ayuda</i>, leveraging his fluent Spanish to manage and connect migrant agricultural workers with opportunity. After his third year as a business major at Georgia Tech, John worked as a missionary and teacher in the slums of Zambia in the summer of 1999. That September, he returned to Lusaka to launch <i>sukulu</i>, the first charter school in Zambia. <i>sukulu</i> has since grown to 15 schools in the Zambian capitol, preparing over 30,000 Zambian children for a world of opportunity. John ran for Governor of Georgia in 2010, and has served six years, focusing on education spending and increasing the potential of Southern small business. He has a wife, Patricia, and adopted Zambian sons John V and Austin.</p>

		John's flagship legislative effort as Governor was the 2012 PEACH Bill. By reforming the outdated legal code and slashing prison budgets, John was able to double the education budget and fund specialty programs like computer science and hardware design. As a result, the number of Georgian computer science graduates and software startups are both projected to double. John will take this same approach as President. Education transforms households, increases income across the board while reducing poverty. But instead of forcing outdated standards across the states, John will replicate his Georgia success by opening up billions for specialized funding as well as vast subsidies in community college, even full scholarships for families under $80,000 total income.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The American style of healthcare depends on free market, competitive choices and price transparency, which is not applicable to a medical emergency. 
            Currently, the United States healthcare costs the government approximately $2 trillion per year. $600 billion (31%) of this hefty sum is not even seen by recipients of healthcare; it goes to administration costs. 
            On a per capita basis, the US spends roughly $280 billion more on administration than twenty one other countries. 
            As it is our general goal to reduce government spending and lower the national debt, we plan to create a more efficient use of the money for administration. 
            Our healthcare system will use some common sense. Obviously it is vital to provide low cost treatments for important ailments that could cause serious health risks, but if a healthcare recipient is dealing with simply a cold or athlete’s foot, it is fair that the recipient use their common sense and do things such as drink liquids, stay in bed, or apply cream. 
            A Kennedy administration will: forbid carriers from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, ensure that all insurance plans have preventive care coverage, including annual low-cost physicals, prohibit carriers from withholding coverage because someone becomes ill, limit large rate increases after illness, or ban lifetime caps on coverage.

            <p class="lead">
            Climate change due to manmade global warming is the greatest threat to our country’s future. Rising sea levels and global temperature increases are a result of our reckless emissions and federal inaction. Millions of people will become environmental refugees from floods, requiring a federal program. Immediately, a Kennedy administration will enforce a carbon tax to incentivise against pollution. We will subsidize clean energy initiatives, allowing for expansion of the private green energy sector, and allowing clean fuel industries to compete against the stagnant oil companies. Finally, my goal for America’s environmental policy is to leverage our global standing and collaborate instead of being cowed into these agreements and being the last ones to join these initiatives (like the Paris Agreements).

            <p class="lead">
		The terrorism has happened throughout our country is a depressing and frightening, but suddenly normal part of our lives. Kennedy is committed to fighting the strongholds of terror groups, including ISIS in the Middle East, as part of a global coalition. However, learning the value of a human life as a missionary in Zambia, he is hesitant to put tens of thousands of American soldiers at risk. Kennedy believes in the power of the American technology sector, and from established solutions like drone strikes to data processing tools such as Palantir, American engineers have made it possible to fight terror in Iraq without leaving home.            </p>

            <p class="lead">
What happened in Chelsea is a sobering reminder of the world we live in. But no surveillance other than a Mussolini-style door to door search can prevent that type of lone wolf attack. This isn’t going to send thousands of young adults beelining it towards ROTC, but most of our national security policies are ineffective, wasteful spending, and invasive of our Constitutional rights to privacy. Take TSA: Have you seen those videos where a man walks through normal security with a gun? That incompetence costs American taxpayers $8 billion every year. Kennedy’s national security proposal is to centralize our programs under the Pentagon and defund the Department of Homeland Security, as to better facilitate exchange of resources between intelligence, military, and national security programs.

            <p class="lead">
The Statue of Liberty reads: “Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore”. The 1951 UN Refugee Convention mandates an American commitment to restoring the rights of “persons to seek asylum from persecution in other countries.” The book of Leviticus, chapter 19 tells us that “when a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them. The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born.” It is our patriotic, humanitarian, and moral obligation to take in refugees. The determination, optimism, and fundamentally American spirit of many refugees has been tainted by hateful and un-American rhetoric that misidentifies their abilities. Our allies in Europe have set a great example in their compassion for refugees, and our inability to find space for decent, hardworking people reflects badly on the global stage. Our great nation must aspire to be the example it was meant to be, and we must rise to the challenge of truly becoming the role model for the rest of the world in all aspects. To refuse thousands of innocents because of the risk that one terrorist will slip in is giving into the terror they aim to perpetuate.
